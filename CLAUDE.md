# Claude Code Guidelines for Albatrion Project

This document provides project-specific guidelines for Claude Code when working on the Albatrion monorepo. All detailed guidelines are maintained in the `.cursor/rules` directory.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This is a **yarn-based monorepo** with the following structure:
- **Root**: Configuration and shared tooling
- **Packages**: Individual libraries in `packages/**/*` with their own CLAUDE.md files
- **Workspaces**: Configured for yarn workspaces

## üìã Important Commands

Use **yarn** commands (not npm) for this project:
- `yarn lint` - Check code style across all packages
- `yarn typecheck` - Verify TypeScript types across all packages  
- `yarn test` - Run tests across all packages
- `yarn run:all <command>` - Run command across all workspaces

## üì¶ Working with Individual Packages

When working on specific packages, **always check the package-specific CLAUDE.md** in each package directory:
- Each package has its own `CLAUDE.md` with specific commands and guidelines
- Package-specific commands use yarn workspace syntax: `yarn workspace @scope/package-name <command>`
- Example: `yarn workspace @canard/schema-form build`

## üìÅ Rule Files Reference

Please follow all guidelines defined in the following files:

### Core Guidelines
- **Project Structure**: `.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc`
- **Code Writing Guidelines**: `.cursor/rules/code-writing-guidelines.mdc`
- **TypeScript Best Practices**: `.cursor/rules/typescript.mdc`
- **React + TypeScript Rules**: `.cursor/rules/typescript-react.mdc`
- **Testing Strategy**: `.cursor/rules/testing-strategy.mdc`
- **Frontend Design Guidelines (Toss)**: `.cursor/rules/toss-basic-frontend-rules.mdc`

### Process Guidelines
- **Changeset Creation**: `.cursor/rules/create-changeset.mdc`
- **Pull Request Guidelines**: `.cursor/rules/pull-request.mdc`

### Plugin Development
- **Schema Form Plugin Guidelines**: `.cursor/rules/create-canard-form-plugin-guidelines.mdc`

## üéØ Quick Reference for Claude Code

When working on this monorepo:

### 1. **First Priority**: Check Package-Specific CLAUDE.md
- Each package in `packages/**/*` has its own `CLAUDE.md` with specific guidelines
- Always read the package-specific CLAUDE.md before working on that package
- Package CLAUDE.md files contain architecture details, testing commands, and development patterns

### 2. **Command Strategy**
- Use `yarn` (not npm) for all commands
- For monorepo-wide operations: `yarn <command>` (lint, typecheck, test)
- For package-specific operations, you have two options:
  - **Full syntax**: `yarn workspace @scope/package-name <command>`
  - **Shortcut commands**: Many packages have shortcuts defined in root package.json
    - Examples: `yarn schemaForm`, `yarn reactUtils`, `yarn promiseModal`
    - See root package.json scripts section for all available shortcuts
- Check each package's CLAUDE.md for available commands

### 3. **Development Workflow**
1. Read and follow all guidelines in the `.cursor/rules` directory
2. Check the specific package's CLAUDE.md for detailed guidance
3. Use yarn workspace commands for package-specific operations
4. Run yarn lint, typecheck, and tests before completing tasks
5. Follow the project structure and naming conventions
6. Create proper changesets and pull requests according to guidelines

### 4. **Available Packages**
Major package groups include:
- **@canard/schema-form\***: Form generation libraries with various UI plugins
- **@winglet/\***: Utility libraries (common-utils, react-utils, json, etc.)
- **@lerx/promise-modal**: Modal management
