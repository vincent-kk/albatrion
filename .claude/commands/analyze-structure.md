CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Before proceeding with ANY task, you MUST execute this exact sequence:

1. Use the Read tool to read `.cursor/rules/analyze-project-structure.mdc`
2. After reading, follow ALL guidelines specified in that file exactly
3. Analyze project structure and generate configuration (as specified in the guidelines):
   - Detect package manager and project type (monorepo/single-package)
   - Scan directory structure and extract tech stack
   - Parse commands from package.json scripts
   - Infer naming and path conventions
   - Generate `.project-structure.yaml` in project root
   - Integrate with requirement-driven development workflows

DO NOT proceed without first reading the guidelines file. This is a mandatory prerequisite.
